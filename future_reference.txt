This is my first time using api, so the Javascript might look a bit messy. The HTML and CSS looks good to me.
In future need to add something more. My future plans are:
-> Adding a loading page.
-> Adding a landing page with some information .
-> Might add high-score next time.
-> In landing page user can decide how many question they want, difficulty and topic.
-> There will page when the game ends and it will show the score high-score.
-> Ending page will also show the wrong answers with questions.
